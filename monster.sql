The majority of FormSwifts customers come from text ads on Google and Microsoft, and at the same time, Search advertising is a major company expense. For these and other reasons, the SEM analyst will fill a role that is central to our success, and will work closely with colleagues from other specialties, particularly developers, designers, product managers, and business managers. The advertising industry has evolved greatly in the past few decades. While traditional types of advertising  from radio jingles to Superbowl commercials to celebrity sponsorships to billboardsremain important, companies like Google and Microsoft have led a quiet revolution in the advertising space. As an SEM analyst, you will work with Google and Microsofts ad platforms. Google ads takes in roughly $50B per year from advertisers like us, and has become the most valuable platform on Earth because it offers three features that are largely absent from traditional media: 1.  Measurement.  In SEM, we track every dollar spent on advertisements and every penny earned as a result. For all of FormSwifts customers, we know what advertisement the customer clicked on, how much was spent to serve the ad, what the exact text of the advertisement read, how the customer moved through our website, what the customer purchased , where and when every step of the process occurred, and much more. This allows us to determine the profitability of our advertising activities with high granularity. 2.  Control.  We can serve highly-customized advertisements to potential customers based on what the customer is searching for, their past search history, prior activity on our website, the customers location, time of day, day of week, etc. We can also control how aggressively we market to users based on these same variables, which lets us dedicate our spending towards messaging users who are the most likely to be interested in FormSwifts services and are most likely to become satisfied long-term customers. 3.  Algorithmic Bidding.  Advertising space on search engines is allocated using an auction model. When you search on Google or any other search engine, an auction occurs in the milliseconds that elapse between when you strike the Enter key and when the results appear. Different advertisers bid against each other to serve ads to specific users, and the results page you seewhich may be absolutely unique to youis the outcome of that auction. These auctions occur so quickly that bidding is necessarily algorithmic.

The majority of FormSwifts customers come from text ads on Google and Microsoft, and at the same time, Search advertising is a major company expense. For these and other reasons, the Growth Marketing Analyst will fill a role that is central to our success, and will work closely with colleagues from other specialties, particularly developers, designers, product managers, and business managers. The advertising industry has evolved greatly in the past few decades. While traditional types of advertising  from radio jingles to Superbowl commercials to celebrity sponsorships to billboardsremain important, companies like Google and Microsoft have led a quiet revolution in the advertising space. As an SEM analyst, you will work with Google and Microsofts ad platforms. Google ads takes in roughly $50B per year from advertisers like us, and has become the most valuable platform on Earth because it offers three features that are largely absent from traditional media: 1.  Measurement.  In SEM, we track every dollar spent on advertisements and every penny earned as a result. For all of FormSwifts customers, we know what advertisement the customer clicked on, how much was spent to serve the ad, what the exact text of the advertisement read, how the customer moved through our website, what the customer purchased , where and when every step of the process occurred, and much more. This allows us to determine the profitability of our advertising activities with high granularity. 2.  Control.  We can serve highly-customized advertisements to potential customers based on what the customer is searching for, their past search history, prior activity on our website, the customers location, time of day, day of week, etc. We can also control how aggressively we market to users based on these same variables, which lets us dedicate our spending towards messaging users who are the most likely to be interested in FormSwifts services and are most likely to become satisfied long-term customers. 3.  Algorithmic Bidding.  Advertising space on search engines is allocated using an auction model. When you search on Google or any other search engine, an auction occurs in the milliseconds that elapse between when you strike the Enter key and when the results appear. Different advertisers bid against each other to serve ads to specific users, and the results page you seewhich may be absolutely unique to youis the outcome of that auction. These auctions occur so quickly that bidding is necessarily algorithmic. Rather than gathering in a hotel ballroom and frantically waving numbered cards in the air in front of a fast-talking auctioneer, we design bidding strategies that can be executed by computers, and search engines provide a set of tools to advertisers like FormSwift to craft such algorithms.','Posted   9   days ago','https://job-openings.monster.com/growth-marketing-analyst-san-francisco-or-remote-ca-us-formswift/c5795b6e-d9a3-4961-9e54-5ddc92e692dd'),(51,'Senior Manager Corporate Public Relations & U.S. Lead','NetApp','Sunnyvale, CA','Marketing Analyst','Title:Senior Manager Corporate Public Relations & U.S. Lead Location: Sunnyvale, CA, US, 94089 Requisition ID:64966 Job Summary Senior Manager, Corporate Public Relations and U.S. Lead Job Summary  NetApp, a global cloud-led, data-centric software company, is seeking a self-motivated, seasoned and creative corporate communications professional to join our team as the Senior Manager of Corporate Public Relations and U.S. Lead.

The Company provides reasonable accommodation for individuals with a physical or mental disability to apply for jobs and to perform the essential functions of their jobs unless it would cause an undue hardship. Employees with disabilities may have separate rights to unpaid leave under the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act or the California Family Rights Act. The Company initiates an interactive process when an applicant or employee requests reasonable accommodations, and when the employer becomes aware of the possible need for an accommodation. The point of the process is to remove barriers that keep people from performing jobs that they could do with some form of accommodation. The process requires an individualized assessment of both the job and the specific physical or mental limitations of the individual that are directly related to the need for reasonable accommodation. The DFEH has created a sample Request for Reasonable Accommodation package to assist employers and employees in engaging in the interactive process. The law does not require the use of these or any other forms to make a request for a reasonable accommodation or to engage in an effective, good faith interactive process. The use of these forms does not insulate a user from liability or create a presumption that discrimination did not occur.

Endless curiosity and a need to dive deeper for understanding. Self-motivation, with the desire and capacity to work both independently and collaboratively. Additional things we value: Experience with Anaplan or other planning tools Experience with Tableau or other analysis/BI tools. Familiarity with MySQL or similar database querying language (youve heard of a left join). Perspectives and backgrounds we dont already have on board: we value new viewpoints and ideas. #LI-MB1','Posted   20   days ago','https://job-openings.monster.com/sales-strategy-operations-analyst-data-systems-san-francisco-ca-us-okta/51e0d442-e222-48bd-97b2-e59452c6c807');
