The CPUC’s current efforts to drive innovation and achieve cost effective energy savings include the requirement that 60% of the investor-owned utilities’ budgets be out sourced to third party entities to bring new and innovative program design into the portfolio. The CPUC also requires program administrators to submit business plan applications for review and approval. We expect the program administrators to propose in these business plans the latest strategies in each of the residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors, and an appropriate budget to meet these strategies. Under the direction of the Project and Program Supervisor, the senior analyst will advise the Commissioners and Administrative Law Judge in review and approval of the program administrator applications’ strategies for: Ability to cost effectively achieve energy savings goals (through third party solicited programs).

If opportunities for catalyzing innovation to expand or accelerate the energy efficiency market in reaching and exceeding savings goals, are left on the table, the senior analyst may propose recommendations to challenge program administrators to address these opportunities.

In general, the Senior Analyst’s role includes developing policy recommendations, soliciting, reviewing, summarizing, and incorporating stakeholder input or proposals, and compiling data and presenting analytical evidence in support or rebuttal of policy options or proposals. The staff’s role in policy implementation includes proactive anticipation of risks and challenges, identifying gaps and inconsistencies in policy’s effectiveness, and ensuring data is collected for evaluation of the success of decision directed activities.

Energy efficiency was the first resource to tackle energy reliability and environmental challenges. As we succeed with efficiency measures becoming commonplace in the market, for example as LED lighting is adopted into code, continuing to identify and deliver cost-effective energy efficiency strategies that go beyond normally occurring reductions becomes harder. Achieving additional energy savings requires continued innovation in technology development and market acceptance. Energy efficiency regulation in California is being reformed to capture the creativity of third-party entities. Still, additional game changers may be needed for energy efficiency to keep pace with rapid advancements in supply and demand technologies and evolving market and policy structures of our integrated grid system. This section’s responsibility for procurement and portfolio management includes review and approval of California’s energy efficiency administrators’ proposed strategies and budget, currently over $600 million annually. The tangible impacts from a statewide portfolio of successful energy efficiency programs are: economic prosperity with delivery of programs, continuing to reduce customer energy bills in a time when the fraction of population unable to afford their bills is rising, reducing greenhouse gas emissions to support reaching state’s goal of a carbon free electric sector by 2045, and reduced costs of procuring new generation and transmission to meet energy demand. All in all, the new pathways for achieving energy savings through innovative regulatory and business practices being set at the CPUC now will set the course for the next couple of decades.

The CPUC also requires program administrators to submit business plan applications for review and approval. We expect the program administrators to propose in these business plans the latest strategies in each of the residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors, and an appropriate budget to meet these strategies. Under the direction of the Project and Program Supervisor, the senior analyst will advise the Commissioners and Administrative Law Judge in review and approval of the program administrator applications\\\\u2019 strategies for: Ability to cost effectively achieve energy savings goals (through third party solicited programs). Forward thinking and complementary efforts for facilitating the success of energy efficiency programs (such as workforce, education, and training programs). Equity, serving hard to reach customers in need. In supporting review and approval of applications, the senior analyst will lead a team of analysts to manage the complex process and diverse subject areas associated with advising the CPUC on adoption of Program administrators\\\\u2019 strategies and budgets. Also, the senior analyst will leverage assessment of past and current program administrator performance. If opportunities for catalyzing innovation to expand or accelerate the energy efficiency market in reaching and exceeding savings goals, are left on the table, the senior analyst may propose recommendations to challenge program administrators to address these opportunities. The senior analyst also can recommend improvements based on lessons learned from the first rounds of third-party solicitation for new, innovative energy efficiency programs. \\\\u00a0 The analyst also oversees the program administrators\\\\u2019 implementation of their energy efficiency portfolio, ensuring they design a complement of programs to successfully reach goals, and that they execute the next round of third party solicitations more effectively, with greater participation, transparency, and accountability, in order to not just meet the 60 percent of the portfolio third-party designed mandate, but that these third party designed programs are new and innovative energy efficiency programs. In general, the Senior Analyst\\\\u2019s role includes developing policy recommendations, soliciting, reviewing, summarizing, and incorporating stakeholder input or proposals, and compiling data and presenting analytical evidence in support or rebuttal of policy options or proposals. The staff\\\\u2019s role in policy implementation includes proactive anticipation of risks and challenges, identifying gaps and inconsistencies in policy\\\\u2019s effectiveness, and ensuring data is collected for evaluation of the success of decision directed activities. The position thus requires an ability to conduct complex economic, policy and/or technical analyses and research. The analyst will also take a broad and strategic view, collaborate across CPUC divisions and with other State agencies, and to add value through considering the bigger picture state and commission goals. Specifically, we will work together to meet California\\\\u2019s goal of a carbon-free electric system by 2045 and through the Commission\\\\u2019s integrated resource planning effort, do so affordably, reliably, and safely.

Energy efficiency was the first resource to tackle energy reliability and environmental challenges. As we succeed with efficiency measures becoming commonplace in the market, for example as LED lighting is adopted into code, continuing to identify and deliver cost-effective energy efficiency strategies that go beyond normally occurring reductions becomes harder. Achieving additional energy savings requires continued innovation in technology development and market acceptance. Energy efficiency regulation in California is being reformed to capture the creativity of third-party entities. Still, additional game changers may be needed for energy efficiency to keep pace with rapid advancements in supply and demand technologies and evolving market and policy structures of our integrated grid system. This section\\\\u2019s responsibility for procurement and portfolio management includes review and approval of California\\\\u2019s energy efficiency administrators\\\\u2019 proposed strategies and budget, currently over $600 million annually. The tangible impacts from a statewide portfolio of successful energy efficiency programs are: economic prosperity with delivery of programs, continuing to reduce customer energy bills in a time when the fraction of population unable to afford their bills is rising, reducing greenhouse gas emissions to support reaching state\\\\u2019s goal of a carbon free electric sector by 2045, and reduced costs of procuring new generation and transmission to meet energy demand. All in all, the new pathways for achieving energy savings through innovative regulatory and business practices being set at the CPUC now will set the course for the next couple of decades.
